Rouncube rcguard plugin

Introduction
----------------------------------------
This plugin logs failed login attempts and requires users to go through
a reCAPTCHA verification process when the number of failed attempts go
too high. This provides protection against automated attacks.

Failed attempts are logged by IP and stored within MySQL. IPs are also
released after a certain amount of time.

Installation
----------------------------------------
Place this directory under plugins/, and enable rcguard within the main
configuration file.

Copy config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php and modify as necessary.

Use the files within SQL/ to create the database layout required for
rcguard. The table should be created in the database used by Roundcube.

Please note that this plugin requires reCAPTCHA keys to work properly.
They can be obtained from http://www.google.com/recaptcha.

Customizing reCAPTCHA
----------------------------------------
Different themes and translations are available. If none of them fit
your needs, create a custom one.

Simply edit rcguard.js. For documentation, see:
http://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/docs/customization.html

Supported databases
----------------------------------------
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
