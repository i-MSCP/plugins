Installing automatic addressbook plugin
---------------------------------------

You need roundcube > 0.4 installed.

automatic_addressbook plugin version 0.2 has been tester against roundcube 0.5 and 0.6.
above versions have been tested against roundcube 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 with larry skin and mysql backend.

Download the latest version archive

1. Uncompress it and move it to the roundcube plugins dir :

    tar xvjf automatic_addressbook-latest.tar.bz2
    mv automatic_addressbook <path_to_roundcube>/plugins/

2. Execute the relevant SQL/<db engine>.initial.sql script on your database (process depends on your DB engine)

3. Add "automatic_addressbook" to the plugins list in
   <path_to_roundcube>/config/main.inc.php or <path_to_roundcube>/config/config.inc.php depending on your roundcube version, for example :

    $rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('automatic_addressbook',);

It works :)


Configuration
-------------

You can customize some settings :

    copy config/config.inc.php.dist to config/config.inc.php
    edit config/config.inc.php as you fancy

Among others, you can choose if your users will have automatic_addressbook enabled or disabled by default (use_auto_abook option).


Upgrading roundcube to 0.6

    Be sure to use the last version of the plugin ;
    upgrade the plugin's database schemes using one of the automatic_addressbook/SQL/*.update.sql scripts.
