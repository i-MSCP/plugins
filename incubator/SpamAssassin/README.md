### SpamAssassin plugin statuses

Enabling a SpamAssassin plugin in the plugin configuration file doesn't
necessarily means that this plugin will be active. This is the case for
plugins that can be enforced in the plugin configuration file. For these
plugins, the rules are as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Plugin status</th>
        <th>Real state</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Enabled only</td>
        <td>
            The plugin is enabled but not active by default. The activation
            decision is left to end-users which can activate/deactivate the
            plugin through their SpamAssassin preferences.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Enabled and enforced</td>
        <td>
            The plugin is enabled and active by default. End-users cannot act
            on that plugin through their SpamAssassin preferences.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Disabled</td>
        <td>
            The plugin is fully disabled. End-users cannot act on that plugin
            through their SpamAssassin preferences.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

For the other plugins, this depend of their nature:

- AWL, DKIM and Rule2XSBody and SPF SpamAssassin plugins are enabled or
  disabled for all users. End-users cannot act on these plugins through
  their SpamAssassin preferences.
- The TextCat SpamAssassin plugin, when enabled, make end-users able to
  change default behavior for language guessing. 


## 3rd-party SpamAssassin ruleset

By default the plugin will setup an additional channel for download of
SpamAssassin ruleset. This channel is provided by Heinlein Support, German ISP
that is specialized in mail servers.
 
Heinlein Support founder and owner [Peer Heinlein](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_Heinlein)
has written several [books](https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&query=123703522)
about Dovecot and Postfix.

## 3rd party SpamAssassin plugins

### DecodeShortURLs

The [DecodeShortURLs](https://github.com/smfreegard/DecodeShortURLs "DecodeShortURLs")
plugin looks for URLs shortened by a list of URL shortening services and upon
finding a matching URL will connect using to the shortening service and do an
HTTP HEAD lookup and retrieve the location header which points to the actual
shortened URL, it then adds this URL to the list of URIs extracted by
SpamAssassin which can then be accessed by other plugins, such as URIDNSBL.

### iXhash2

[iXhash2](http://mailfud.org/iXhash2/ "iXhash2") is an unofficial improved
version of  [iXhash](http://www.ixhash.net/ "iXhash") plugin for SpamAssassin,
adding async DNS lookups for performance and removing unneeded features. It's
fully compatible with the iXhash 1.5.5 implementation.

## Included Roundcube Plugins

### MarkAsJunk2 plugin

If enabled in the plugin configuration file, the `MarkAsJunk2` Roundcube plugin
adds a new button to the mailbox toolbar to mark the selected messages as
'Junk'/'Not Junk' and will also learn the bayesian database. It will also
detach original messages from spam reports if the message is not junk.

### SAUserPrefs plugin

If enabled, the `SAUserPrefs` Roundcube plugin adds a 'Spam' tab to the
'Settings' page to allow the users to change their SpamAssassin preferences
which are stored in the i-MSCP SpamAssassin database.

The SpamAssassin preferences displayed in Roundcube will vary depending the
changes you make in the plugin configuration file.

Roundcube user config: Settings -> Spam

#### Move Spam into Junk folder

If you want to move Spam into the users Junk folder automatically, you will
need to use Dovecot and the `Managesieve` Roundcube plugin that is included
in the i-MSCP RoundcubePlugins plugin.

#### SpamAssassin user preferences

The default SpamAssassin user preferences are stored in the table `userpref` of
the i-MSCP SpamAssassin database.

#### Global SpamAssassin preferences

These are the `$GLOBAL` default values which will be set during plugin
installation.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>username</th>
        <th>preference</th>
        <th>value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>required_score</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>rewrite_header Subject</td>
        <td>*****SPAM*****</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>report_safe</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>use_bayes</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>use_bayes_rules</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>bayes_auto_learn</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>bayes_auto_learn_threshold_nonspam</td>
        <td>0.1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>bayes_auto_learn_threshold_spam</td>
        <td>12.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>skip_rbl_checks</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>use_razor2</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>use_pyzor</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$GLOBAL</td>
        <td>use_dcc</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

You shouldn't change the `$GLOBAL` user preferences unless you know what you're
doing. Bear in mind that the plugin could override your changes.

#### Per-User SpamAssassin preferences

If you have enabled the `sauserprefs` Roundcube Plugin, end-users will be able to
change their SpamAssassin preferences under Roundcube -> Settings -> Spam.

The user preferences are stored in the `userpref` table with the mail
address as username.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>username</th>
        <th>preference</th>
        <th>value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>user@example.com</td>
        <td>required_score</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>user@example.com</td>
        <td>rewrite_header Subject</td>
        <td>[SPAM-_HITS_]</td>
    </tr>
</table>
